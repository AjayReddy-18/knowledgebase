# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Knowledge Base

Hi, I'm Ajay! This is my personal documentation space where I organize everything I learn, explore, and build.

## ðŸ§  What's in here?

- **Git**: Setup, scoping, tips, and advanced workflows  
- **NuGet**: Creating and publishing packages  
- **Vim, Shell, Productivity**: Coming soon!

> I use this space as a second brain â€” it's open, searchable, and always evolving.

## ðŸš€ Why This Exists?

I'm a strong believer in learning by documenting. This site helps me:
- Solidify my understanding
- Revisit what I learned quickly
- Share with others when helpful
